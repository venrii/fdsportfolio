---

For a school project, I contributed to the development of a Financial Calculator application, with a primary focus on implementing the Mortgage Calculator feature.

## Project Overview

The Financial Calculator project aimed to provide various financial computation tools, including mortgage calculations, investment projections, and loan amortization schedules. My contribution was centered on the `MortgageActivity.cs` file, where I implemented key functionalities for the mortgage calculation.

## Key Features Implemented

- **Mortgage Payment Calculation:** Developed functions to calculate monthly mortgage payments based on loan amount, interest rate, and loan term.
- **Amortization Schedule:** Implemented an amortization schedule to display the breakdown of each payment into principal and interest components.
- **Extra Payments:** Added functionality to account for extra payments, allowing users to see how additional payments could reduce the loan term and interest paid.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend:** C#, .NET
- **Tools:** Visual Studio, GitHub for version control

## Challenges and Solutions

### Accurate Calculations

Ensuring the accuracy of mortgage calculations was critical. I validated the functions with multiple test cases and cross-referenced results with standard financial calculators to ensure reliability.

### User-Friendly Interface

To make the tool user-friendly, I focused on clear input fields and result displays. I collaborated with team members working on the front-end to integrate the mortgage calculator seamlessly into the overall application.

## Conclusion

Contributing to the Financial Calculator project, specifically developing the mortgage calculator, enhanced my skills in C# and financial computations. This project demonstrated the practical application of software development in solving real-world financial problems, albeit as a school assignment.
